# Lab 16: Configuring Firewalld for Network Security

## README.md

### Objectives

By the end of this lab, students will be able to:

* Understand the fundamentals of **firewalld** and its role in Linux network security
* Install, start, and manage the firewalld service
* Create and manage firewall rules using firewalld commands
* Configure firewall zones and assign network interfaces
* Manage services and ports within firewall zones
* Test firewall rules to validate secure access
* Implement secure communication policies using zones and rich rules
* Troubleshoot common firewalld configuration issues

### Prerequisites

* Basic Linux command-line skills
* Understanding of networking concepts (IP, ports, protocols)
* Familiarity with Linux system administration
* Knowledge of common services (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP)
* Basic TCP/IP knowledge

### Lab Environment

* CentOS/RHEL 8 or 9 system
* Root or sudo access
* firewalld package available
* Network connectivity
* Multiple network interfaces

## Conclusion

In this lab, you successfully installed and configured **firewalld**, created and tested firewall rules, implemented zone-based security policies, and applied advanced rich rules for granular control. These skills are essential for securing Linux servers in real-world environments and are directly applicable to system administration, DevOps, cloud security, and RHCSA exam preparation.

Firewalld serves as the first line of defense against unauthorized access and network-based attacks, making it a critical component of Linux security hardening.
