# Lab 15: Managing SELinux Policies

## 📜README

### 🔢Objectives

By the end of this lab, students will be able to:

* Understand the fundamentals of SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) and its security model
* Check and interpret SELinux status using `sestatus` and `getenforce`
* Modify SELinux policies using the `semanage` command-line tool
* Configure SELinux file contexts, port contexts, booleans, and user mappings
* Troubleshoot SELinux denials by analyzing audit logs
* Apply SELinux best practices for system security hardening

### Prerequisites

* Basic Linux command-line skills
* Understanding of file permissions and ownership
* Familiarity with system administration concepts
* Knowledge of log file analysis
* Access to a Red Hat-based Linux system (RHEL 9 / CentOS Stream 9)

### Lab Environment

* OS: RHEL 9 or CentOS Stream 9
* SELinux: Enabled and configured
* Required tools: Pre-installed or installed during the lab

## Conclusion

In this lab, you:

* Verified and interpreted SELinux status and modes
* Modified SELinux policies using `semanage`
* Configured file contexts, ports, booleans, and users
* Diagnosed and resolved SELinux denials using audit logs
* Applied SELinux to a real-world Apache deployment

### Why This Matters

* Strengthens system security (Defense in Depth)
* Essential for enterprise Linux and compliance environments
* Core skill for Red Hat certifications and Linux security roles

### Next Steps

* Practice with databases, FTP, and containers
* Explore custom SELinux policy writing
* Study SELinux integration with Podman and Kubernetes
