# Lab 12: Automating Tasks with Cron and systemd Timers

## README.md

### Overview

This lab focuses on automating administrative tasks in Linux using **cron** and **systemd timers**. Students will learn how to schedule jobs, create reusable automation scripts, monitor execution, and troubleshoot common issues using both traditional and modern scheduling mechanisms.

### Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

* Understand differences between cron and systemd timers
* Create and manage cron jobs using crontab syntax
* Configure systemd service and timer units
* Test, monitor, and verify scheduled tasks
* Debug common cron and systemd timer issues
* Apply automation best practices in Linux

### Environment

* CentOS / RHEL 8 or 9
* Root or sudo privileges
* cron and systemd pre-installed

## Conclusion

In this lab, you successfully automated Linux tasks using both cron jobs and systemd timers. You learned how to schedule tasks, create maintainable scripts, monitor execution, and troubleshoot failures.

### Key Takeaways

* Cron is simple and widely used
* systemd timers provide better logging and dependency handling
* Automation improves reliability and efficiency

### Real-World Use Cases

* Automated backups
* Log rotation
* System health monitoring
* Maintenance and cleanup jobs

This lab builds essential automation skills required for system administration and RHCSA-level environments.
