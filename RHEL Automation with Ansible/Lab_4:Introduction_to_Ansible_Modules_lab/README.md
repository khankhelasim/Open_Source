# Lab 4: Introduction to Ansible Modules

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, students will be able to:

• Understand what Ansible modules are and their purpose in automation
• Use common Ansible modules including yum, apt, and service
• Write Ansible tasks using these modules to manage packages and services
• Create playbooks that automate package installation and service management
• Troubleshoot common issues when working with Ansible modules
• Apply best practices for module usage in real-world scenarios

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, students should have:

• Basic understanding of Linux command line operations
• Familiarity with YAML syntax and structure
• Completion of previous Ansible labs covering inventory and basic playbook creation
• Basic knowledge of package managers (yum/dnf for Red Hat-based systems, apt for Debian-based systems)
• Understanding of Linux services and systemd

---

## Lab Environment Setup


### Your lab environment includes:

• One Ansible control node (CentOS/RHEL-based)
• Two managed nodes (one CentOS/RHEL-based, one Ubuntu-based)
• Pre-installed Ansible on the control node
• SSH connectivity already configured between nodes
• You can use Containers as nodes but there are certain limitations like systemd😂
