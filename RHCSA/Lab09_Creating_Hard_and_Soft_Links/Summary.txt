Lab 9 Summary – Creating Hard and Soft Links

- Created hard links using ln and verified inode numbers.
- Tested hard link behavior (shared data block).
- Learned that deleting a hard link does not remove file data.
- Created symbolic links using ln -s.
- Observed that symbolic links break if the target file is deleted.
- Tested cross-filesystem limitations (hard links fail, symlinks work).
- Practiced verification using ls -l and ls -li.
