Lab 8 Notes – Managing Files and Directories

Commands:
mkdir = create directory
mkdir -p = create nested directories
mv = move or rename files
cp = copy files
cp -r = copy directories
rm = delete files
rm -r = delete directories recursively
rmdir = delete empty directory
tree = view directory hierarchy
Wildcard: *.txt matches all .txt files

Common Issues:
- rmdir only works for empty dirs
- rm -r is powerful; use carefully
- Linux paths are case-sensitive
